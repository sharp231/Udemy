    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <h2>The family Sepiidae,<a href="#nowhere">which</a> contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean
        waters.
        They are
        mostly shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[11] They have
        an unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and
        the Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By
        the time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold and
        deep for these warm-water species to cross.[12] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the
        Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although populations may occur as far south as South Africa. They are
        found in sublittoral depths, between the low tide line and the edge of the continental shelf, to about 180 m
        (600 ft).[13] The cuttlefish is listed under the Red List category of "least concern" by the IUCN Red List of
        Threatened Species. This means that while some over-exploitation of the marine animal has occurred in some
        regions due to large-scale commercial fishing, their wide geographic range prevents them from being too
        threatened. Ocean acidification, however, caused largely by higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted into the
        atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat.[14] Some studies suggest that ocean acidification does not impair
        normal embryonic development, survival rates or body size.</h1>
